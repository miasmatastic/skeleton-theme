### Templates

[Templates](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/templates#template-types) control what's rendered on each type of page. The theme scaffolds [JSON templates](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/templates/json-templates) for easy merchant customization.

### Sections

[Sections](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/sections) are modular content blocks customizable through the admin interface. All enhanced sections include comprehensive `{% schema %}` definitions for merchant control.

### Blocks

[Blocks](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/blocks) create flexible layouts within sections. Each block has its own settings and can be reordered by merchants.

## Developer Tools

### Enhanced Customization System

**CSS Variables Integration**: All sections utilize CSS variables for dynamic styling:
- Real-time customization through Shopify admin
- Consistent theming across components

### Performance Optimization

- **Minimal JavaScript**: Essential functionality only
- **CSS Variables**: Dynamic styling without inline styles
- **Critical CSS**: Essential styles loaded first

### CSS & JavaScript

We recommend using the [`{% stylesheet %}`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/liquid/tags#stylesheet) and [`{% javascript %}`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/liquid/tags/javascript) tags for optimal performance. Code is automatically deduplicated across multiple includes.

#### `critical.css`

The theme separates essential CSS into a dedicated `critical.css` file for faster initial page loads.

### Schemas

When developing schema-driven components, follow these guidelines:

**Single property settings**: Use CSS variables for direct CSS property mapping:

```liquid
<div class="collection" style="--gap: {{ block.settings.gap }}px">
  ...
</div>

{% stylesheet %}
  .collection {
    gap: var(--gap);
  }
{% endstylesheet %}

{% schema %}
{
  "settings": [{
    "type": "range",
    "label": "Gap",
    "id": "gap",
    "min": 0,
    "max": 100,
    "unit": "px",
    "default": 0
  }]
}
{% endschema %}
```

**Multiple property settings**: Use CSS classes for complex styling:

```liquid
<div class="collection {{ block.settings.layout }}">
  ...
</div>

{% stylesheet %}
  .collection--full-width {
    /* multiple styles */
  }
  .collection--narrow {
    /* multiple styles */
  }
{% endstylesheet %}

{% schema %}
{
  "settings": [{
    "type": "select",
    "id": "layout",
    "label": "Layout",
    "options": [
      { "value": "collection--full-width", "label": "Full Width" },
      { "value": "collection--narrow", "label": "Narrow" }
    ]
  }]
}
{% endschema %}
```
